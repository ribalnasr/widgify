# Widgify
## _Use Ready-Made Widgets for your Angular projects, or create your own ones._

Widgify is an Angular library that makes it easy to create and/or reuse widgets.
Widgets are components with a settings property that you can use within your Angular code without having to write more than one html line.

## NOTE: This library is still in its early development phase.

Widgify is perfect for creating content management systems and dashboards for your application. It can be used as a complete UI or just a part of it.
